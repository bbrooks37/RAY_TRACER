1\. Project Overview
--------------------

This ray tracer simulates how light interacts with 3D objects to generate photorealistic images. Unlike traditional rasterization, ray tracing works by tracing light rays from the camera through each pixel into the scene. When a ray hits an object, the program calculates its color based on light sources, material properties, and shadows.

The application has evolved from a basic offline renderer to an interactive tool with a real-time display and a Dear ImGui-based control panel, allowing users to manipulate the camera and scene objects dynamically.

2\. Features
------------

*   **Real-time Rendering:** Displays the ray-traced scene in an interactive window using OpenGL.
    
*   **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Powered by Dear ImGui, providing sliders and color pickers for scene parameters.
    
*   **Camera Controls:**
    
    *   **Mouse Orbit:** Right-click and drag to orbit the camera around the scene's look-at point.
        
    *   **Mouse Wheel Zoom:** Scroll the mouse wheel to adjust the camera's orbital radius (zoom in/out).
        
    *   **GUI Sliders:** Fine-tune camera eye position, look-at point, and field of view (FOV) via ImGui.
        
*   **Object Picking:** Left-click on a sphere in the scene to select it and modify its properties (e.g., color) via the GUI.
    
*   **Geometric Primitives:**
    
    *   **Spheres:** Basic spherical objects.
        
    *   **Planes:** Infinite flat surfaces, used for the ground.
        
*   **Basic Shading:** Implements Lambertian diffuse lighting.

5\. Building the Project
------------------------

This project uses CMake for cross-platform compilation.

### Prerequisites

*   A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC)
    
*   CMake (version 3.10 or higher)
    
*   GLFW development libraries
    
*   GLEW development libraries
    

### Steps

1.  cd ray\_tracer
    
2.  git clone https://github.com/ocornut/imgui.git imgui
    
3.  mkdir buildcd build
    
4.  cmake -DCMAKE\_BUILD\_TYPE=Debug ..
    
    *   For a Release build (optimized, no debug symbols), use cmake -DCMAKE\_BUILD\_TYPE=Release ...
        
    *   On Windows with Visual Studio, you might specify a generator, e.g., cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 16 2019".
        
5.  cmake --build .This will compile the source code and create the ray\_tracer executable in the build/ directory.
    

6\. Running the Application
---------------------------

After building, you can run the ray tracer from the build directory:

*   **Camera Zoom (Mouse Wheel):** Scroll the **mouse wheel** to adjust the camera's distance from the lookAt point.
    
*   **Object Picking (Left-Click):** **Left-click** on a sphere in the main rendering window to select it. The "Selected Object Properties" panel in the GUI will then show its details.
    
*   **GUI Sliders & Color Pickers:**
    
    *   **Camera Properties:** Use the sliders for "Eye Position", "LookAt Point", "FOV", and "Orbit Radius" to adjust camera settings. You can click and drag the numbers or double-click to type a precise value.
        
    *   **Selected Object Properties:** Once an object is selected, use the "Color" picker to change its color in real-time.
        

8\. Extending the Project
-------------------------

Here are some ideas for extending this interactive ray tracer:

*   **Add More Geometric Shapes:** Implement Object derived classes for cylinders, cones, cubes, triangles, etc.
    
*   **Implement More Shading Models:**
    
    *   **Specular Reflection:** For shiny surfaces (e.g., Phong or Blinn-Phong model).
        
    *   **Refraction:** For transparent objects (e.g., glass, water) using Snell's Law.
        
    *   **Full Reflection:** For mirror-like surfaces, by recursively tracing reflected rays.
        
*   **Texture Mapping:** Apply images to object surfaces.
    
*   **Anti-aliasing:** Reduce jagged edges by sampling multiple rays per pixel (e.g., supersampling, jittered sampling).
    
*   **Acceleration Structures:** Implement BVH (Bounding Volume Hierarchy) or KD-trees for significantly faster ray-scene intersection tests in complex scenes.
    
*   **Different Light Types:** Area lights, directional lights, spot lights.
    
*   **Soft Shadows:** Simulate realistic shadows with soft edges.
    
*   **Depth of Field:** Simulate camera focus effects.
    
*   **Global Illumination:** Implement more advanced techniques like Path Tracing or Photon Mapping for realistic indirect lighting.
    
*   **Multithreading:** Parallelize the ray tracing loop to utilize multiple CPU cores for faster rendering.
    

9\. Debugging Journey & Robustness
----------------------------------

Developing this project involved navigating several common and complex C++ and graphics programming challenges. Understanding these issues and their solutions is crucial for building robust applications.

*   **Git Initialization & Committing Issues:** Initial struggles with git init, git add ., and git commit often stemmed from files not being in the expected directory or a confused Git state. The solution involved verifying file presence (ls -F), ensuring a clean Git repository (rm -rf .git for a fresh start), and correctly using git add . and git commit -m "...". This reinforced the importance of **Version Control Proficiency** and **Systematic Troubleshooting**.
    
*   **undefined reference to 'main' (Linker Error):** A classic C++ linker error. This was resolved by ensuring the main function had a standard signature (int main(void)) and that its object file was correctly linked by CMake. This highlighted the distinction between **Compilation vs. Linking**.
    
*   **Missing Headers/Libraries (cannot open source file):** This indicated missing development packages (GLFW, GLEW) or incorrect CMake configuration for including Dear ImGui's source files and linking against necessary libraries. The fix involved installing dependencies via package managers and meticulously updating CMakeLists.txt with find\_package, include\_directories, and target\_link\_libraries. This emphasized **Dependency Management** and **CMake Configuration**.
    
*   **Black Screen / No Rendering (OpenGL Core Profile):** The initial switch to an interactive window resulted in a black screen because modern OpenGL (Core Profile) requires shaders and VAOs/VBOs, deprecating older fixed-function pipeline calls. The solution involved implementing basic **Vertex and Fragment Shaders** and setting up a fullscreen quad with VAOs/VBOs to display the ray-traced texture. This was a deep dive into **Modern OpenGL Concepts**.
    
*   **Object Picking Issues (Only Ground Selectable):** Initially, only the large ground plane was selectable, or spheres below it were unpickable. This was due to the ray always hitting the closest object and the spheres being partially submerged. The solution involved refining the picking logic to explicitly skip the ground plane in the closest-hit search and adjusting sphere positions to sit correctly on the plane. This demonstrated **Algorithm Refinement** and **Attention to Edge Cases**.
    
*   **Persistent vtable for Plane Linker/Compiler Errors:** This was a multi-stage C++ polymorphism bug:
    
    1.  **undefined reference to 'vtable for Plane':** The linker couldn't find the virtual table. Initially, the Plane::~Plane() = default; definition was missing from src/Plane.cpp, or Plane.cpp wasn't linked.
        
    2.  **error: definition of implicitly-declared ‘virtual Plane::~Plane()’:** After adding the definition to src/Plane.cpp, it became a redundant definition because the virtual ~Plane() = default; declaration in src/Plane.h already implies the compiler will generate it.
        
    3.  **Solution:** The final fix was to **explicitly declare virtual ~Plane() = default; in src/Plane.h** and **remove the redundant Plane::~Plane() = default; line from src/Plane.cpp**. This ensures the compiler knows the destructor is virtual and generates its definition once, allowing the linker to find the vtable. This was a critical lesson in **Deep Understanding of C++ Defaulted Functions and Virtual Destructors**.
        
*   **Segmentation fault (core dumped) on Startup/Mouse Interaction:** This runtime crash was particularly challenging.
    
    1.  **Root Cause 1 (GLFW/ImGui Callback Conflict):** ImGui's default InitForOpenGL installs its own callbacks. If our code also registered callbacks, it could lead to conflicts and invalid memory access within ImGui's internal state.
        
    2.  **Root Cause 2 (Degenerate Camera Basis Vectors):** When the camera looked straight up or down, the cross-product used to calculate its u (right) vector could become a zero vector. Normalizing this zero vector leads to division by zero (NaN values) and subsequent crashes.
        
    3.  **Solution:**
        
        *   **Robust Callback Setup:** Changed ImGui\_ImplGlfw\_InitForOpenGL(window, false) to _not_ install ImGui's callbacks. Instead, all GLFW callbacks (glfwSetMouseButtonCallback, glfwSetCursorPosCallback, etc.) were manually set to custom wrapper functions. These wrappers _first_ call ImGui's respective handlers and _then_ proceed with our application logic, but only if ImGui::GetIO().WantCaptureMouse or WantCaptureKeyboard is false. This establishes a clear event handling hierarchy.
            
        *   **Robust Camera Basis:** Implemented a Camera::updateBasis() method that includes a check for the u vector being near zero. If so, it uses a fallback (e.g., Vec3f(1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f)) to prevent division by zero during normalization. This method is called whenever the camera's position or lookAt changes.
            
        *   **Debugging Tool:** The use of **GDB (gdb ./ray\_tracer then run, bt)** was instrumental in pinpointing the exact crash location, allowing for targeted fixes.
            
    
    *   **Skillset:** **Advanced Debugging (GDB Backtrace Analysis)**, **Inter-Library Integration**, **Robustness Engineering (Edge Cases, Floating-Point Precision)**, **Event Handling Design**.
